oldTests is from the folder Jamie/matlab/testing/multitests

newMatlab will reformat the old code and seperate the various methods of ADMM to be specific to their functionality.
e.g for vanillaQE-ADMM.m:
it will onl handle the rectangular case, does not have tensorweights or misfit weights as an option

Should make the code perform better and easier to read.
