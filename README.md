# QuadraticEnvelopeTransform
Methods used in the paper 'Quadratic Envelope Regularization for Structured Low Rank Approximation' presented at the ICASSP 2019 conference in Brighton, U.K.

#Methods
The methods discussed presented in this paper are in the folder `SquareMethods/`

The new method introduced in this paper is in the folder `QuadraticEnvelopes/`.

Some implementation of previously researched methods which were discussed and tested against are found in the folders `HardChopping/` & `NuclearNorms/`.

#Testing/Examples
These methods can be run independently of each other, however there is an example of some tests which were run in the file `testRunner.m` which also makes use of the `config.m`. It's worth running this example to see how the set up works for each method.
